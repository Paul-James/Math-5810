# Using Hadley's Bigvis for the airline data 2013 to 2016
#
# to use this code, first run the code in install-bigvis.R
# then unzip the file Airline.7z (I use 7-zip)
# into the folder ../Data/Airline
# You can adjust the folder relative to your desired working directory
# Usually I assume the working directory is the home of bigvis-06.R
